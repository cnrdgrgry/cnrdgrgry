# Hello, I'm Conrad

`Full Stack Developer, with Network+, Security+ and Linux+ certifications.`

A mid-life career changer looking to make a creative contribution in the world of web and software development. I come from an eclectic background of Music (Batchelors degree), Retail (High Street and Mail Order Fulfillment) and most recently Bus driving, bringing with me a wide experience in creating great user experiences in varied environments and situations.

I started making a change into tech in early 2023 but swiftly decided I enjoyed my time on the command line (Linux), and that then morphed into coding while starting to learn Python for cross-platform scripting.

Lucky enough to have been accepted onto the inaugral [Technative Digital Academy BootCamp](https://www.technativedigital.com/hire_a_technative/), I'm now developing my learning, issue solving and coding skills so that I can help to make great things!
